#+title:  How to build and run my emacs configuration

* What you need to already have on your machine

 - ~emacs-25.x~ is installed ::  It is possible to install a
      new emacs without destroying your current installation
      of a different version of emacs.

 - ~org-version~ is less than 9.x :: ~emacs-25.2.2~ comes
      with ~org-version 8.2.10~ by default.  (This may not
      be true with later versions of ~emacs~, though.).  

* How to install

 - 1. Clone the repository :: From  https://gitlab.com/vxcg/prj/emacs/emacs.git.

 - 2. Run the makefile :: From the top level, run ~make -k all~.
   
 
* Result of a successful install

 - ~build~ :: directory is generated
 - ~build/docs~ :: holds the html docs
 - ~build/code~ :: holds the code 
 - ~build/code/init.el~ :: is the emacs init file
 - ~org-version 8.3.4~ ::  is installed and supercedes any
      other org version previously installed.

* Launching emacs with the init file
From the command line, type
#+BEGIN_SRC bash :eval no
emacs -l /path/to/build/code/init.el
#+END_SRC

* Packages
* Git repos
