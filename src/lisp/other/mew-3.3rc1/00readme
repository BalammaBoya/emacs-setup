This is the stable release of Mew 3.3.

			     <Platforms>

Please use Emacs 20.7 or later (including Emacs 21.1), or XEmacs

			    <Installation>

(1) Edit "Makefile" as you like.

(2) Type 'make'.

(2.1) Mew's info is formatted by Emacs 20.7. So, the info could not be
visible with other Emacsen like XEmacs. In this case, type 'make info'
to format the info.

(2.2) If you want to format the Japanese info, type 'make jinfo'.

(3) Type 'make install'.

If you have the "install-info" command, the following line will be
automatically added to the "dir" file.  Otherwise, add it by yourself.

		     <Transition from Mew 1.94.2>

Since Mew is independent on the IM packages, files in "~/.im"
should move to "~/Mail".

	% cd ~/.im
	% mv Addrbook ~/Mail

If you want to use the same functionality of the IM 'Config' feature,
please configure 'mew-config-alist'. For more information, please see
the document of 'mew-config-alist'.
