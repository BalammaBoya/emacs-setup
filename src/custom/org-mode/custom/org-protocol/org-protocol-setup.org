#+title: Org-protocol-capture setup on Firefox
#+author: Venkatesh Choppella

* Introduction

=Org-protocol-capture= is an extremely handy way of
capturing stuff from a web page into an org buffer.  The
captured data includes the url of the page, its title, and
any piece of selected text.  For all this to work, it is
necessary to register the =org-protocol= with firefox.  

Unfortunately, the =org-protocol= documentation at
http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.html seems
quite out of date because recent versions of Firefox (I am
running Version 10.x, but I believe versions from 3.x
onwards) have completely revamped the way protocols are
registered.

In this note, I describe the steps I took to get 
=org-protocol-capture= to work with Firefox.

* Setting up Firefox view

In your Firefox, make sure the set the Bookmarks toolbar is
visible:

#+begin_example
Views -> Toolbars -> Bookmarks Toolbar
#+end_example

In Firefox 10, which I am using currently, the Bookmarks
toolbar appears /below/ the url box.

* Setting up your Emacs configuration

#+begin_example
(server-start)   ;; Run emacs server
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/org/protocol/")  
(require 'org-protocol)  ;; load the org-protocol library
#+end_example

* Add =org-protocol-capture= as a bookmark

** Right-click and create a new bookmark

Create a bookmark by right-clicking on the Bookmark toolbar.
This will pop up a window 


#+CAPTION: Opening a new bookmark in the bookmarks toolbar
#+LABEL: fig:new-bookmark
#+ATTR_HTML: width="400"
[[file:bookmark-new.png]]


** Fill in the details of the new bookmark

#+CAPTION: Filling the bookmark with org-protocol-capture
#+LABEL: fig:filled-bookmark
#+ATTR_HTML: width="400"
[[file:bookmark-filled.png]]


In the Location field, fill in the following:

#+begin_example
javascript:location.href='org-protocol://capture://'+
      encodeURIComponent(location.href)+'/'+
      encodeURIComponent(document.title)+'/'+
      encodeURIComponent(window.getSelection())
#+end_example 


This will create an "org-capture" bookmark on your Firefox
Bookmarks toolbar.

* Registering =org-protocol= with Firefox

Firefox has completely changed the way protocols need to be
registered.  I found the following from
http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2009-11/msg00866.html
where Robin Green summarises the registration process:

#+begin_example

1. In about:config, create a boolean key
"network.protocol-handler.expose.org-protocol" and set it to False

2. Create a simple web page containing a link to the URL org-protocol://test

3. Open the web page you just created

4. Click on the link

5. Choose emacsclient as the associated application in the dialog box
that appears

#+end_example


Here is a minimal [[file:protocol-reg-trigger.html]] that contains a
link to =org-protocol://test=. 

You may need to enter the full pathname of the =emacsclient=
application needed to handle =org-protocol://=.  It should
be something like

#+begin_example
/usr/bin/emacsclient
#+end_example

* Setting up templates for org-capture

The last thing left to do is include org-capture specific
customizations in your =.emacs= file.  The main
customizations includes defining a collection of
=org-capture-templates=.  The details of the syntax of these
templates is given in the org-mode online manual at
http://orgmode.org/manual/Capture-templates.html.  Here are
the customizations I use.  Most of them are adapted from the
wonderful org-mode tutorial "Org Mode - Organize Your Life
In Plain Text" by Bernt Hansen at
http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html.

#+begin_example
(require 'org-capture)
;; from
;; http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.html#sec-6-1-1
;; and 

(setq org-capture-templates nil)
(setq org-capture-templates
      (quote (("t" "todo" entry (file "~/org/refile.org")
               "* TODO %?\n%U\n%a\n  %i" :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
              ("n" "note" entry (file "~/org/refile.org")
               "* %? :NOTE:\n%U\n%a\n  %i" :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
              ("j" "Journal" entry (file+datetree "~/org/diary.org")
               "* %?\n%U\n  %i" :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
              ("w" "org-protocol" entry (file "~/org/refile.org")
               "* TODO Review %c\n%U\n  %i" :immediate-finish t)
              ("p" "Phone call" entry (file "~/org/refile.org")
               "* PHONE %? :PHONE:\n%U" :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
              ("h" "Habit" entry (file "~/org/refile.org")
               "* NEXT %?\n%U\n%a\nSCHEDULED: %t .+1d/3d\n:PROPERTIES:\n:STYLE: habit\n:REPEAT_TO_STATE: NEXT\n:END:\n  %i"))))


;; Setting up org-capture

(setq org-directory "~/org")
(setq org-default-notes-file 
      (concat org-directory "/refile.org"))
(define-key global-map "\C-ck" 'org-capture)
#+end_example
